# AppliedDL
Repositiory for building general purpose DL application viz. Anomaly Detection, Time Series forecasting, 
language understanding etc. The aim of this repository is to build end to end applications (ETL/Streaming+Solution+
Frontend) for the above mentioned applications. The solutions shall not only be limited to Deep Learning but might draw
inspiration from other domains of ML viz. Bayes Nets, Decision trees etc. wherever required. Emphasis will also be
placed on using concepts from pure and applied maths, statistics and computation theory wherever they might augment our
understanding of the problem under consideration and lead to more sound solutions.
